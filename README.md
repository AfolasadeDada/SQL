# Maji Ndogo Water Project Database Audit - SQL Notebook

This SQL notebook documents the independent audit of the Maji Ndogo Water Project database, which records water sources across the country. The audit was initiated following inconsistencies identified by Chidi Kunto and his team.

### Objective:
The primary goal of this audit was to assess the integrity and accuracy of the data stored in the database. Specifically, the notebook provides insights into:

1. **Data Integrity**: Verifying that the data has not been tampered with and is accurate.
2. **Data Accuracy**: Ensuring that the information stored can be trusted for decision-making and governance.

### Methodology:
The audit involved a detailed examination of the database records and the procedures governing data entry and modifications. The aim was to ensure alignment with principles of good governance and data-driven decision-making.

### Key Components:
- **Introduction**: Setting the stage for our data exploration journey.
- **Generating an ERD**: Understanding the database structure was a critical step. By generating an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD), we were able to visualize and comprehend the relationships between the different entities within the database.
- **Integrating the Report**: After analyzing the database, the auditor report was added to the database. This integration ensures that the audit findings are transparently recorded and easily accessible.
- **Linking Records**: As part of the audit process, employee data was linked to the report through SQL queries, ensuring consistency between the workforce records and the findings of the audit.
- **Gathering Evidence**: A complex query was developed to extract evidence of tampered records, ensuring that the truth is revealed and the integrity of the data is preserved.

### Findings:
- The majority of the data was found to be reliable and consistent with best practices.
- However, several records were flagged due to suspected tampering and require further investigation.

### Contents:
This repository includes:
- SQL queries used during the audit.
- Identified inconsistencies and tampered data records for review.
- Recommendations for data integrity improvements.

This notebook serves as a transparent record of the audit process and findings, providing stakeholders with a clear view of the databaseâ€™s current state and areas needing attention.
