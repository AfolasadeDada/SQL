# Maji Ndogo Water Project Database Audit - SQL Notebook

This SQL notebook documents the independent audit of the Maji Ndogo Water Project database, which records water sources across the country. The audit was initiated following inconsistencies identified by Chidi Kunto and his team.

### Objective:
The primary goal of this audit was to assess the integrity and accuracy of the data stored in the database. Specifically, the notebook provides insights into:

1. **Data Integrity**: Verifying that the data has not been tampered with and is accurate.
2. **Data Accuracy**: Ensuring that the information stored can be trusted for decision-making and governance.

### Methodology:
The audit involved a detailed examination of the database records and the procedures governing data entry and modifications. The aim was to ensure alignment with principles of good governance and data-driven decision-making.

### Key Components:
- **Introduction**: Setting the stage for our data exploration journey.
- **Generating an ERD**: Understanding the database structure was a critical step. By generating an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD), we were able to visualize and comprehend the relationships between the different entities within the database.
- **Integrating the Report**: After analyzing the database, the auditor report was added to the database. This integration ensures that the audit findings are transparently recorded and easily accessible.
- **Linking Records**: As part of the audit process, employee data was linked to the report through SQL queries, ensuring consistency between the workforce records and the findings of the audit.
- **Gathering Evidence**: A complex query was developed to extract evidence of tampered records, ensuring that the truth is revealed and the integrity of the data is preserved.

### Findings:
- The majority of the data was found to be reliable and consistent with best practices.
- However, several records were flagged due to suspected tampering and require further investigation.

### Contents:
This repository includes:
- SQL queries used during the audit.
- Identified inconsistencies and tampered data records for review.
- Recommendations for data integrity improvements.

This notebook serves as a transparent record of the audit process and findings, providing stakeholders with a clear view of the database’s current state and areas needing attention.



# Maji Ndogo Water Project: Final SQL Analysis and Action Plan

This SQL notebook documents the final phase of analysis and planning for the Maji Ndogo Water Project. After a comprehensive audit and examination of water sources and infrastructure, we are now preparing to translate our findings into actionable improvements.

### Introduction
Our journey has led us through an extensive data exploration, and now we are ready to take the final steps. This notebook focuses on bringing together the key pieces of data across various tables to create a clear path forward.

### Key Analysis Steps:
- **Joining Pieces Together**: By combining data from multiple tables, we identified key insights about water sources and the populations they serve.
- **Finding the Data We Need**: Queries were built to extract vital data on the condition and distribution of water infrastructure, providing a foundation for our decisions.
- **The Last Analysis**: This phase focused on uncovering the final insights that would guide our improvement efforts.

### Insights:
Through our analysis, we identified critical trends and issues:
1. **Rural Water Sources**: The majority of water sources in Maji Ndogo are rural.
2. **Shared Taps**: 43% of the population uses shared taps, with over 2,000 people sharing one tap in many cases.
3. **Home Water Infrastructure**: 31% have water infrastructure at home, but nearly half of these systems are non-functional due to pipe, pump, and reservoir issues.
4. **Contaminated Wells**: 18% use wells, but only 28% of these are clean, with issues particularly in Hawassa, Kilimani, and Akatsi.
5. **Long Wait Times**: Citizens wait for water for over 120 minutes on average, with the longest queues on Saturdays and during mornings and evenings.

### Plan of Action:
Our final goal is to implement a practical plan that addresses these key issues. Here’s our approach:
1. **Prioritizing Shared Taps**: Given the large number of people relying on shared taps, improving these should be the first step.
2. **Well Rehabilitation**: Cleaning contaminated wells, especially in rural areas, will provide immediate benefits.
3. **Repairing Non-Functional Infrastructure**: Fixing broken systems will reduce queue times and ensure better access to water.
4. **Strategic Resource Allocation**: Installing new taps in homes will be deprioritized unless queue times are unmanageable.
5. **Focusing on Rural Areas**: Most of the work will be in rural regions, where road conditions, supplies, and labor pose additional challenges.

### Practical Implementation in the Database:
To ensure the successful execution of this plan, we will create a new table in the database. This table will provide the teams with essential information, including:
- **Addresses**: The location of water sources (street, town, province).
- **Water Source Type**: The type of source (tap, well, etc.) and the necessary improvements.
- **Progress Tracking**: Space for teams to update the status of repairs, completion dates, and any upgrades made.

### Summary and Next Steps:
This notebook provides a final summary of our findings and a detailed plan to improve water access in Maji Ndogo. As we move from analysis to action, this repository serves as both a technical reference and a practical guide for implementation.
